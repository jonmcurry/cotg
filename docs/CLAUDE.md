## Claude Rules
Rule 1: NEVER disable or remove a feature to fix a bug or error.
Rule 2: NEVER fix an error or bug by hiding it.
Rule 3: NO silent fallbacks or silent failures, all problems should be loud and proud.
Rule 4: Always check online documentation of every package used and do everything the officially recommended way.
Rule 5: Clean up your mess. Remove any temporary and/or outdated files or scripts that were only meant to be used once and no longer serve a purpose.
Rule 6: NEVER use character emoji's in any of the code or documentation.
Rule 7: Create a .md file with what your plan is to resolve issues or to develop new functionality and put it in a checklist.
Rule 8: No shortcuts - fully resolve issues by solving it the right way and not creating cascading failures elsewhere.
Rule 9: Commit to github
Rule 10: Keep track with the changelog.md file

## Collaboration Guidelines
- **Challenge and question**: Don't immediately agree or proceed with requests that seem suboptimal, unclear, or potentially problematic
- **Push back constructively**: If a proposed approach has issues, suggest better alternatives with clear reasoning
- **Think critically**: Consider edge cases, performance implications, maintainability, and best practices before implementing
- **Seek clarification**: Ask follow-up questions when requirements are ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways
- **Propose improvements**: Suggest better patterns, more robust solutions, or cleaner implementations when appropriate
- **Be a thoughtful collaborator**: Act as a good teammate who helps improve the overall quality and direction of the project
